\section{Reduction for TSO}
\label{sec:reduction-for-tso}
In this section, we explain how the reduction theory of Lipton can be used for TSO.
Our goal is to present sufficient conditions for programs such that when a program satisfies these conditions the program is guaranteed to be unable to distinguish TSO semantics from SC semantics. 
This is the first step of applying reduction to TSO programs.
In the following sections, we will show how we can extend it to programs which are initially TSO-specific.

\begin{definition}[Movers]
\label{def:movers}
Let $P$ be a labelled program and let $\aliequivgeneric$ be an equivalence relation over $\alirunsx {tso} P$.
Let $s$ be a statement that occurs in some method's body $m$ of $P$.
Then, $s$ is {\em left-mover in $\aliequivgeneric$} if for any $\alisequencex r=\alisequencex r[1]\ldots\alisequencex r[k]\in\alirunsx {tso} P$ we have $\alisequencex r[i]\alisequencex r[i+1]=(R',t':s')(R,t:s)$ such that $\alimemtracex {s'} \alipotsox {\alimemtracex {\alisequencex r}} \alimemtracex s$ does not hold, then there exists a run $\alisequencex {r'}$ in $[\alisequencex r]_{\aliequivgeneric}$ such that $\alisequencex {r'}\langle 1,i\rangle=\alisequencex r\langle 1,i-1\rangle \alisequencex r[i+1]$.

Similarly, $s$ is {\em right-mover in $\aliequivgeneric$} if for any $\alisequencex r=\alisequencex r[1]\ldots\alisequencex r[k]\in\alirunsx {tso} P$ we have $\alisequencex r[i-1]\alisequencex r[i]=(R,t:s)(R',t':s')$ such that $\alimemtracex {s} \alipotsox {\alimemtracex {\alisequencex r}} \alimemtracex {s'}$ does not hold, then there exists a run $\alisequencex {r'}$ in $[\alisequencex r]_{\aliequivgeneric}$ such that $\alisequencex {r'}\langle 1,i\rangle=\alisequencex r\langle 1,i-2\rangle \alisequencex r[i]\alisequencex r[i-1]$.
\end{definition}

Intuitively, $s$ is left mover (resp. right mover) if reordering $s$ before (resp. after) any other statement that is concurrent with $s$ does not change the behavior (all runs belonging to the same equivalence have the same behavior).
In the classic definition of reduction, the equivalence relation requires that the two sequences be permutations of each other and that the end states are identical, which corresponds to $\tsoequiv$ in the TSO context.
The reason for the added generality will become clear once we generalize reduction with abstraction.

Our first result about movers follows immediately from definitions.
\begin{lemma}
Let $P$ be a program.
All of its TSO runs are SC-like if all remote writes are left-movers in $\tsoequiv$.
Dually, all of its TSO runs are SC-like if all local actions (i.e. ignoring remote writes) are right-movers in $\tsoequiv$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Take any run $\alisequencex r\in \alirunsx {tso} P$.
If all remote writes are left-movers in $\tsoequiv$, then there exists a run $\alisequencex {r'}\tsoequiv\alisequencex {r}$ such that all local writes are synchronous. 
Then by Def.~\ref{def:sc-like}, $\alisequencex r$ is SC-like.
A symmetric argument applies for the second case.
\end{proof}

%All of its TSO runs are observationally SC-like if all remote writes are left-movers in $\tsoequiv$.
%Dually, all of its TSO runs are observationally SC-like if all local actions (excluding remote writes) are right-movers in $\tsoequiv$.
%\end{lemma}
This result depends on a strong constraint, all updates being left-movers or all reads being right-movers, which is unlikely to be satisfied by many programs.
In what follows we will provide a series of incrementally more general results.
Fix a labelled program $P=\{m_1,\ldots,m_n\}$.
Let $\sigma$ be a partitioning of (the methods of) $P$.
A {\em $\sigma$-partitioned runs} of $P[T]$ is the subset of $\alirunsx {tso} {P[T]}$ containing all and only those runs in which each $t$ executes methods from the same partition.
\begin{lemma}
Let $P$ be a program and $\sigma$ be a partitioning of $P$.
If $\sigma$ is such that in $\sigma$-partitioned runs of $P[T]$ for each partition, all remote write actions executed by all the methods in the partition are left-movers or all local actions executed by all the methods in the partition are right-movers, then $\sigma$-partitioned runs are SC-like.
\end{lemma}
Call a subset of $\alirunsx {tso} {P[T]}$ {\em singular} if it contains all and only those runs in which each thread $t\in T$ runs at most one method; i.e. the {\sc\small Init}-transition is executed at most once by each $t$.
Then the following is a particular instance of the previous result.
\begin{corollary}
All singular TSO runs of $P[T]$ are SC-like if for each method $m_i$, either all of its local actions are right-movers in $\tsoequivstrict$ or all of its remote write actions are left-movers. 
\end{corollary}
We can specialize even further, obtaining the following, which is also implied by triangular-race freedom of \cite{Owe2009}.
\begin{corollary}
Let $P$ be such that each $m_i$ either only updates the shared memory (no read actions) or only reads shared memory (no write actions).
Then all singular TSO runs of $P[T]$ are SC-like.
\end{corollary}

%Now we will investigate the impact of placing fence statements in restricting the non-SC-like behaviors of programs.
\paragraph{Write atomicity.}
We will call a statement $s$ in $P$ {\em atomic} if all transitions whose source is $s$ are executed without interference. 
In particular, a memory update statement ($s=\alimemx i\mathtt{:=} e$) is atomic if the two transitions caused by $s$ are adjacent; i.e. the local write action due to $s$ is synchronous.
The reason we introduce write atomicity should be clear: By Lem.~\ref{lem:synchronous-write}, if one can prove that for any TSO run of program $P$ there exists an equivalent run in which $s$ is atomic, then we can safely transform $s$ to $\aliatomicx {s\mathtt{;} \alifence}$.
This substitution decreases the number of possible interleavings, which in turn simplifies the analysis of the program.
Indeed, the latter is a step towards the ultimate goal of analyzing the whole program under SC semantics.
For the following fix an update statement $s$ and let $s^{loc}$ and $s^{rem}$ denote its local and remote write actions.
\begin{lemma}
If in any TSO run in which $s^{loc}$ is executed by some thread $t$, all the combined write actions executed by $t$ up to the occurrence of $s^{loc}$ are atomic and $s$ is left-mover, then $s^{loc}$ and $s$ are atomic.
\end{lemma}
This naturally leads to the following special instance which gives an insight about how fence statements lead to SC-like programs.
\begin{corollary}
If in any TSO run in which $s^{loc}$ is executed by thread $t$, there exists a fence action executed by $t$ preceding $s^{loc}$, no other local write actions by $t$ occur between the two actions and $s$ is left-mover, then $s^{loc}$ and $s$ are atomic.
\end{corollary}
This means that, unlike the general case, in order to argue that a write immediately following a fence statement is atomic, we only need to prove that its matching remote write action is left-mover. 
There is a dual of this result which we state next.
\begin{lemma}
If in any TSO run in which $s^{loc}$ is executed by thread $t$, there does not exist any read action executed by $t$ until the occurrence of $s$, then $s^{loc}$ is right-mover and $s^{loc}$ and $s$ are atomic.
\end{lemma}
The next result which is a special case of the previous result explains why the use of fence statements restricts the runs of a TSO program to SC-like behaviors.
\begin{corollary}
Let $s;C;\alifence$ be a code block in some $m_i$ such that $C$ does not contain any read of shared memory (no statements of the form $r:=\alimemx e$).
Then $s$ and all the writes in $C$ are atomic.
\end{corollary}
